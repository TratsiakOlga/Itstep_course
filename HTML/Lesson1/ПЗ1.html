    <h1>Vehicle</h1>

Vehicles incude wagons,<br> bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (train, trams), watercraft (ships,<br> boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and<br> spacecraft.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
